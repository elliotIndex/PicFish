  "A couple in their nineties are both having problems remembering things. They decide to go to the doctor for a checkup. The doctor tells them that they're physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember. Later that night while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair. His wife asks, Where are you going? To the kitchen, he replies. Will you get me a bowl of ice cream? Sure. Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it? she asks. No, I can remember it. Well, I'd like some strawberries on top, too. You'd better write it down, because you know you'll forget it. He says, I can remember that! You want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries.",
  "On my way home from work, I stopped at Taco Bell for a quick bite to eat. In my billfold are a $50 bill and a $2 bill. I figure that with a $2 bill, I can get something to eat and not have to worry about anyone getting irritated at me for trying to break a $50 bill. Me: Hi, I'd like one seven-layer burrito please, to go. Server: That'll be $1.04. Eat in? Me: No, it's to go. At this point, I open my billfold and hand him the $2 bill. He looks at it kind of funny. Server: Uh, hang on a sec, I'll be right back.He goes to talk to his manager, who is still within my earshot. The following conversation occurs between the two of them: Server: Hey, you ever see a $2 bill? Manager: No. A what? Server: A $2 bill.",
  "The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.",
  "So I came to this bar to work up the courage to put an end to it all, I buy a drink, I drop a capsule in and sit here watching the poison dissolve; then you, you jack-ass, show up and drink the whole thing! But enough about me, how's your day going?",
  "I am writing to thank you for bouncing my check with which I endeavored to pay my plumber last month.  By my calculations, three nanoseconds must have elapsed between his depositing the check and the arrival in my account of the funds needed to honor it.  I refer, of course, to the automatic monthly transfer of funds from my modest savings account, an arrangement which, I admit, has been in place for only thirty-one years. You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity, and also for debiting my account $30 by way of penalty for the inconvenience caused to your bank."
